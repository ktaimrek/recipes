Ingredients:
 - 125 g rice
 - 25 cL water
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
 1. Pour the cold water into a large pan and bring to a boil. Then add rice and salt. Bring to a boil again, and stir.
 
 2. Cover the pan well. Lower the heat of your stove and cook for 15 minutes over very low heat.
 
 3. Check that all the liquid has been absorbed. If there is any, put it on a low heat again for a few minutes while covering. The rice at the end of cooking must be dry, tender and firm.
